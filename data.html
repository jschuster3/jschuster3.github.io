		<h2>Collection and Manipulation of Data</h2>
		<p>In order to fit the model, we used data gathered from Major League Baseball's PITCHf/x System. PITCHf/x is a pitch 
			tracking system that has been in use since about 2006. Two cameras are set up in every MLB stadium, and they are 
			used to track the speed, break, spin, and location of the baseball for every single pitch thrown in a season. 
			<br><br>We collected data using <a href="http://baseballsavant.com/pitchfx_search.php" target="_blank">Baseball 
			Savantâ€™s PITCHf/x search tool.</a> We downloaded the data for every pitch 
			thrown in the 2014 season separated by batter handedness. We then added several columns to the data set in order to 
			get a batter profile. These extra columns included batter handedness, K%, BB%, and HR%. K%, BB%, and HR% measure 
			the rate of strikeouts, walks, and homeruns per plate appearance respectively. We decided that to get a more 
			accurate picture of a batter's profile we should use historical data ranging back three seasons. In order to 
			calculate these rates, we downloaded PITCHf/x data for the 2011-2013 seasons and then calculated each batter's 
			cumulative rates. We then attached these final rates to all of their 2014 plate appearances to finalize our data 
			fame .</p><br><br>
			
		<h2>Fielding Independant Pitching</h2>
		<p>	One of the formulas commonly associated with the sabermetric movement is Fielding Independent Pitching (FIP). The 
			formula derived by Tom Tango is based on the idea that there are only three true outcomes: walk, strikeout, and 
			homerun. These outcomes are the only ones that are entirely dependent upon the hitter and the pitcher. These events 
			do not rely on any other members of the defensive team. Because we isolated our input variables to only include 
			pitcher and batter stats, we decided it was appropriate to apply this concept when predicting which outcomes are 
			likely to happen.</p>
