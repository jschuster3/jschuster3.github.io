		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In baseball, one of the most common strategic decisions that must be made 		throughout the game is determining which pitch to throw in which situation. Teams spend millions of dollars each 		year on scouting reports to determine a specific hitter’s weaknesses and strengths and the best approach when 		facing them at the plate. We aim to develop a computer model that can predict the likelihood of particular 		outcomes and decrease the necessary spending for such scouting reports. Using PITCHf/x data, we will develop batter 		and pitcher profiles using statistics, such as handedness, strikeout percentage, homerun percentage, contact 		percentage, and other measures of plate discipline, and determine how these batters usually perform against 		pitches with particular movement in a particular location. We will use all of the player profile statistics and 		pitch profile statistics as inputs in a logistic regression model. The model will then determine the probability 		of particular outcomes such as strike, ball, contact, and homerun. Our definitions of these outcomes are 		all-inclusive and mutually exclusive. Once a model is obtained, we hope to optimize the model to find the ideal 		location to throw a particular pitch in a given situation. A successful model could help in developing future 		scouting reports for baseball teams.
