			<h2>The Strike Zone</h2>
			<p> The first thing that we need to discuss so that we may begin working with the fitted model is defining the
				 strike zone. The Official Rulebook of Major League Baseball defines the strike zone as follows:</p> 
				 <blockquote cite="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/umpires/strike_zone.jsp">"The Strike Zone is that 
				 space over home plate which is between the batter's armpits and the top of his knees when he assumes his 
				 natural stance."</blockquote> 
				 <p>Therefore, to quantify the strike zone numerically we must look at the pitchF/X data. 
				 We started by noticing that the strike zone is 17 inches wide. So taking into account that the pitchFX 
				 system catagorizes everything in relation to the center of the plate, we deifined the horizontal size of 
				 the strike zone to be any pitch with a horizontal location within [-0.708,0,708]. To quantify the strike 
				 zone vertically we looked at all the data and vertically quantified the strike zone to start at the 
				 point in which the umpire consistantly called more strikes than balls and end at the location in which 
				 the umpire quantified more pitches to that location as balls than strikes. Doing this we came up with a 
				 strikezone size as any pitch with a vertical location within [1.8,3.7]. Therefore our finalized Strike 
				 Zone is any pitch that has a horizontal location within [-0.708,0.708] and a vertical location within 
				 [1.8,3.7].</p>
			<p> We then broke the strike zone up into nine zones where zone one includes those pitches up an in to a right 
				handed hitter and zone three includes those pitches up and in to right handed hitter. Additionally zone 5 
				quantifies those pitches right down the middle of the plate and belt high, where zone 7 quantifies those 
				pitches down and in to a rightie and zone 9 quantifies those pitches down and in to a left handed hitter. 
				Below is a diagram of the zones, to view it from the cather's perspective with a right handed hitter at 
				the plate hit the Right-Handed Hitter button and to view from the cathers perspective with a left handed 
				hitter at the plate hit the Left-Handed Hitter button. Please note it initializes to a Right Handed hitter 
				at the plate</p>

			<br>
			<p> To work with our model we need to further specify pitch locations within each zone to use for prediction. 
				To do this we catagorized pitches by zone(1-9) and then took the average over all pitches thrown to get the 
				average x-y coordinate that allows us to predict over all zones.</p><br><p>These locations are:</p>

			<h2>Calculating the Rates</h2>
			<p> The second thing we need to discuss is how to calculate Home Run Rate, Walk Rate and Strikeout Rate. The 
				definitions are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Home Run Rate is defined as the number of home runs hit by the player over total player plate 
					appearances</li>
				<li> Walk Rate is defined as the number of walks a player draws over total player plate appearances</li>
				<li> Strikeout Rate is defined as the number times a player strikes out over total player plate 
					appearances</li>
			 </ul>
			 <p> A simple calculator for these rates is provided below. If a rate is within the major league averages the 
				 "Within MLB Averages?" next to the textboox turns green, if higher than major league average it appears red. 
				 <br></p>
			<div id="ratescalc" role="form">
				 Home Runs: <input id="HR" type="text" name="HR"><br>
				 Strikeouts: <input id="SO" type="text" name="SO"><br>
				 Walks: <input id="BB" type="text" name="BB"><br>
				 Plate Appearances: <input id="PA" type="text" name="PA"><br><br>
				 <button id="calculate" type="button">Calculate the Rates</button><br><br><br>
				 Home Run Rate: <input id="HRR" type="text" name="HRR"><span id="HRROK"> Within MLB Averages?</span><br>
				 Strikeout Rate: <input id="SOR" type="text" name="SOR"><span id="SOROK"> Within MLB Averages?</span><br>
				 Walk Rate: <input id="BBR" type="text" name="BBR"><span id="BBROK"> Within MLB Averages?</span><br></div>
				 <br>
			<p> These rates can also be obtained by locating the player's statistics on either <a
				 href="http://www.fangraphs.com/" target="_blank"> Fangraphs</a> or <a
				 href="http://www.baseballreference.net/" target="_blank"> Baseball Reference</a>. Please keep in mind that 
				 historical rates were used to fit the model, so historical rates should be used make predictions.</p>

			<h2>Obtaining Pitch Speed, Horizontal and Vertical Movement</h2>
			<p> To obtain pitch speeds as well as horizontal and vertical movements for pitches, we recommend using <a
				 href="http://www.brooksbaseball.net/" target="_blank">Brooks Baseball</a>. Once on the website look up the 
				 player card for the required pitcher and there you can obtain the pitch speeds as well as the 
				 corresponding movement.
